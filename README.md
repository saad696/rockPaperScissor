# rockPaperScissor
Description:
A simple Rock, Paper, Scissor’s game which I developed Using JavaScript. 
So how this game basically works is that below there are three buttons which are of rock, paper and scissor when the player clicks on any of those three buttons the player is basically choosing for him/herself and based on the player selection the computer will randomly choose it’s selection and the results will be based on the basic rules of rock paper and scissor. That whether its a draw or a win of the player or computer. Scores will be displayed above on the score section. The ultimate winner is who reaches the score count of 10 first and then the score counter will reset.
